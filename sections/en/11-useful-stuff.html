			<h1 class="title title--large">Useful stuff</h1>
			<div class="text-block">
				<h2 class="title title--medium title--left">Addons</h2>
				<p>This is not a definitive list of <em>THINGS YOU NEED</em>, but a list of addons/WeakAuras that I like and find useful. </p>
				<br>
				<h3 class="title title--small title--left">Addon Managers</h3>
				<h3 class="title title--small title--left">A brief message about addon managers</h3>
				<p>As someone who values their privacy online, I feel like it's important that I mention the Overwolf client is BAD and all of its privacy options are OPT-OUT by default, instead of OPT-IN. I encourage you to use an open source addon manager like <a href="https://wowup.io">wowup.io</a> or <a href="https://github.com/layday/instawow">instawow</a>. Just my two cents.</p>
				<h3 class="title title--small title--left">Timers</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://wago.io/M+Timer">M+ Timer (WeakAura)</a> - Mythic plus timer with a lot of bonus features, including auto-gossip/interact, MDT integration, and more!</li>
					<li><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/angry-keystones">Angry Keystones</a> - Another take on the keystone/mythic+ timer. Displays affix rotation schedule and current affixes as well as providing chest timers and kill count % ingame.</li>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://wago.io/dfdungeons">Dragonflight Dungeons</a> - Comprehensive alerts for trash and boss abilities. Covers things bossmods do not. Optionally offers simple verbal queues such as "stack, spread, dance, etc." <strong>Absolutely invaluable.</strong></li>
