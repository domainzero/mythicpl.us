# mythicpl.us
A simple flat file site designed to load quickly and give M+ information at a glance (and in multiple languages thanks to some great contributors, but mostly [@amarques](https://github.com/amarques)!) 

## Contributing
Fork the page and make any changes, then submit a pull request.
If you are making style or script changes, be sure to adjust the links and scripts to use the static local copies as they are currently set to be fed through a server side minifier.  

Most notably, you'll have to call all the individual Javascript files as they are currently all being concatenated and minified to reduce requests.  

If you need assistance, reach out to me on Discord
