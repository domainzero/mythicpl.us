				<h1>routes tl;dr</h1>
                <p>Thanks to everyone who provided me additional information or made me aware of skips I hadn't done. Special shoutouts to Anchises for writing nice, short guides. disclaimer: I am not a writer by trade so please forgive me as I endlessly revise this trash to make it read better.</p>
                <p>I appreciate and listen to your feedback. If you have suggestions please open an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/domainzero/mythicpl.us/issues">GitHub</a> page so I can keep track of all the suggestions.</p>

        <h1>The Arcway</h1>
            <h2>Route</h2>
            <p>The route given to you at the beginning of the instance is randomized and you will have to go whatever way has open doors. This will determine your route through the rest of the dungeon. You'll either be forced to go the Demon way or the Withered way at the start.</p>
            <p>From then on you pretty much just follow the map to the bosses. I'm not aware of any sections where you should invis pot to skip a trash pull. There are plenty of optional trash pulls you can skip.</p>

        <h2>Trash tips and warnings</h2>
            <p>Most of the trash in here <i>sucks</i> at some parts. I'm going to break it down by area since you may not encounter the trash in the same order in every run with the exception of Forgotten Spirits.</p> 
            <p>Forgotten Spirits appear randomly through the dungeon and cast <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=226269/torment">Torment</a>. While this spell can be interrupted and line-of-sighted, the mob will not move after aggroed. You can use this to your advantage if you accidentally pull one or need to reset your stacks of Torment. Spirits can wipe your group quickly if you don't figure out a way to deal with one when you pull it.</p>
        
            <h3>Demon area trash</h3>
                <p>Eredar Chaosbringers bring a lot of wipe potential to any pull that they're a part of. They have a big pool of spells they can choose to cast but we're going to talk about the two most dangerous. 
                <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211757/portal-argus">Portal: Argus</a> opens a portal to Argus and spawns a bunch of imps. If Portal: Argus is cast on pretty much any keystone difficulty you're going to have a bad time, with an almost guaranteed wipe at higher keystone difficulties. Make sure you interrupt it. 
                They also cast <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=226285">Demonic Ascension</a>. On death the Chaosbringer will be revived as a giant demon corehound or a wrathguard with full health and new AoE abilities. This cast can be interrupted and the buff can be purged/dispelled/spellstolen before the Chaosbringer dies, so there's no reason for your group to ever have a Chaosbringer revive as a demon.
                </p>
                <p>In most packs with a Chaosbringer there is also at least one Wrathguard Felblade. They do large tank damage and blink to random people in the group, debuffing them with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211756">Searing Wound</a>. Searing Wound cannot be dispelled and does lots of damage at higher keystone difficulties, so use a personal if you are afflicted.</p>
                <p>Wyrmtongue Scavengers will trash your group with randomly targeted, high damage abilities. Don't underestimate them.</p>
                <p>Dreadborne Seers cast <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211771">Prophecies of Doom</a> which will ruin your group at high keystones. If enraging is active you will need to burst down the Dreadborne Seer immediately after it enrages so you don't take a Prophecies of Doom after the enrage. Use personals or big AoE healing cooldowns if you're getting trashed by Prophecies of Doom. In addition to Prophecies of Doom AoE damage, the Dreadborne Seer will summon Eyes of the Beast that randomly target players with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211777">Optic Blast</a>. If you eat an Optic Blast and a Prophecies of Doom back-to-back you're going to die.

            <h3>Withered trash</h3>
                <p>At the very start of the Withered path there's a bunch of Plagued Rats. They put a stacking disease on targets that needs to be dispelled. Stack up, stun and AoE the rats down.</p>
                <p>The normal Withered trash isn't too intense. Interrupt <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=210662">Unstable Flux</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=210684">Siphon Essence</a>.</p>

            <h3>Arcane trash (Ivanyr)</h3>
                <p>Get out of <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211217">Arcane Slicer</a> cast by the Arcane Anomalies or die.</p>
                <p>Kick <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=226206">Arcane Reconstitution</a> on all arcane mobs or RIP your keystone since the mobs will full heal.</p>
                <p>Kick <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211115">Phase Breach</a>. Its damage can be unmanagable at higher keystone difficulties if multiple casts get off.
                <p>Line-of-sight the Mana Wyrms until you have one pack left (which you can engage freely). You can line-of-sight using the pillars on the bridge or line-of-sight near the entrance to Ivanyr's room.</p>

            <h3>Spider trash (Nal'tira)</h3>
                <p>The mini spiders explode on death. Don't be near them. Don't be overzealous when pulling with Bolstering active because more shit spawns as you're killing trash and you will bolster it</p>
                <p>The normal size spiders will root people and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211543">Devour</a> them. You can use Disengage/Blessing of Freedom, etc to get out of the root or damage the spider down to 30% HP.</p>
                <p>Stack up for the second wave of jumping spider trash so the spiders can be quickly cleaved down.</p>
                <p>Be careful with your postioning here because the boss will drop down into the middle of the room after the trash dies and can be body pulled easily</p>

            <h3>Nightborne trash (Corstilax)</h3>
                <p>Pretty lowkey. Make sure you move the mobs out of the Nightborne Reclaimer's <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211037">Celerity Zone</a> or watch your tank melt. DPS should get in the Celerity Zone for a huge haste buff.</p>
                <p>Nightborne Spellswords will put <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211000">Nether Wound</a> on the tank which can add up to some nasty damage in certain circumstances.</p>
                <p><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=210868">Arcane Barrier</a> can be stopped by stunning or knocking back from behind.</p>

        <h2>Boss tips</h2>
            <p>You'll either get Ivanyr or Xakal for your first boss depending on RNG, use Bloodlust on whatever you get, and then again on the third boss. You should have lust up by the time you get to phase 2 of Advisor.</p>
            <p><strong>Ivanyr</strong> - Pretty much the same as normal. Avoid the balls of mana, interrupt Overcharge Mana immediately. Ivanyr doesn't have any one-shot abilities to worry about.</p>
            <p><strong>General Xakal</strong> - Avoid <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=212030/shadow-slash">Shadow Slash</a> or die. Getting knocked into a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=197776/fel-fissure">Fel Fissure</a> by <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=197810/wicked-slam">Wicked Slam</a> will one shot you on most keystone difficulties. Be prepared to use a personal for Wicked Slam if you aren't at full HP. Do not get hit by the Bombardment by the bats. The bats that come down during the fight can be cleaved, but don't keep them up too long as they enrage and can do fatal damage. <strong>Do not send them to the tank if Necrotic is active (tricks, misdirect, etc)</strong> unless their stacks have fallen off.</p>
            <p><strong>Corstilax</strong> - You can cheese this boss by keeping up the Reclaimer from the pull just before the boss until it casts a Celerity Zone. You can use this Celerity Zone to do mad DPS to the boss early on. Free people from <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=195791">Quarantine</a> immediately or they will die. Pick up the haste pools on the ground for a huge haste buff, but make sure you don't get sucked in and stunned. Dodge Supression, dodge Destabilized Orbs.</p>
            <p><strong>Nal'tira</strong> - Dodge Blink Strikes or get one shot. Kill the add spiders that get spawned or you will get rooted in Blink Strikes and die a horrible death.</p>
            <p><strong>Advisor Luther Vandross</strong> - Avoid standing next to the floating geodes. They explode and will kill you. Do not run with the force wave, push through it. Interrupt Accelerating Blast or let the cast go through and spellsteal the buff. The fastest route back will depend on where you were placed after after phase transition. If you are spawned at Ivanyr's or Xakal's arena, head north toward Vandros. If you were placed at Corstilax or Nal'tira, head through the middle. When you make it back to the boss, run away with Unstable Mana or die and continue doing the earlier mechanics. Bloodlust after re-engaging.</p>


    <h1>Black Rook Hold</h1>
        <h2>Route</h2>
		  <p>Take the right door, invis pot at the last possible moment and skip all the starting trash. From here on out the dungeon is very linear and there isn't any trash you can really skip.</p>
        <h2>Trash tips and warnings</h2> 
            <p>The stairs after the first boss are full of spiders. They explode after death. Do not stand in the green swirly they leave on the ground or you will die a horrible death.</p>
            <p>Risen Arcanist's <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=200248">Arcane Blitz</a> can be deadly if not interrupted. Make sure the Arcanists die quickly.
            <p>Risen Scout's <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=200291/knife-dance">knife dance</a> can be enough to wipe a group at high keystone levels (especially with Fortified) and should be line of sighted or stunned/knocked back to be interrupted.</p>
            <p>Wrathguard Bladelord's <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=201139/brutal-assault">Brutal Assault</a> should be interrupted via knockback or stun as it deals insane damage, especially at higher keystones.</p>
            <p>The bat corridor before Smashspite is only as bad as you make it. The bats do not aggro unless they are attacked or are fixated on a nearby player by a Felspite Dominator casting <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=203163/sic-bats">Sic Bats!</a>. Your tank can pull the Felspite Dominators on the landing down to the bottom of the stairs so you don't cleave and pull a million bats. You can pull the last 3 Dominators into the boss room for the same purpose. Interrupt <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=227913/felfrenzy">Felfrenzy</a>. On problematic affixes (necrotic, enraging) make sure you stun and kite the bats if you are fixated.</p>
        
        <h2>Boss tips</h2>
            <p>Amalgam of Souls - Business as usual. Use Bloodlust or Heroism here. Killing the adds that are spawned at 50% is a top priority unless everyone has a cooldown that will allow them to live through <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=196587/soul-burst">soul burst</a>. Soul Burst will one shot most classes even with one stack of <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=196930/soulgorge">Soulgorge</a> at most keystone levels.</p>
            <p>Illysanna Ravencrest - On most keystone levels you can ignore the adds and burn the boss. If people are taking too much damage from leaving the Risen Arcanist up it may be best to just kill it (on higher difficulties I would say this isn't optional). If you have an ability that can negate a spell cast (Feign Death, Aspect of the Turtle, active spell mitigation) use it to avoid Brutal Glaive if you notice it being cast on you.</p>
            <p>Smashspite - Business as usual again. At high keystone levels it may be beneficial to use a personal before <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=198073/earthshaking-stomp">Earthshaking Stomp</a> is cast. Make sure no one takes two charges or they will most likely be instantly killed. (Do mechanics lol)</p> 
            <p>Kur'talos Ravencrest/Latosius/Dreadlord guy (Bloodlust on Phase 2) - Phase 1 is business as usual, do not get hit by the bouncing glaive or the big purple lazer. When the fight transitions to dreadlord phase, use a personal cooldown to avoid the first <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=202019/shadow-bolt-volley">shadow bolt volley</a>. I have seen people get oneshotted by it on 10+. Use heroism or bloodlust after you get buffed (shortly after the first Shadow Bolt Volley). Kill <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=201733/stinging-swarm">stinging swarm</a> immediately as its damage is out of control on all keystone levels. Avoid purple and green.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h1>court of stars</h1>
        <h2>Route</h2>
            <p>Kill the first sentry patrol. You can skip the first construct by jumping through the canal to the right. Hug the building to your right and kill the next construct as well as the trash near the pylon. Be mindful of your positioning and AoE use here as you are surrounded by trash and it WILL wipe you if you pull too much. Kill the trash on the bridge and you are near the first boss.</p>
            <p>After killing the first boss, proceed into the building, killing the construct on the way. After traversing the building you'll be up in the next trash area. Be mindful here as there are plenty of patrols to accidentally pull. There's no strict route here as you have to make your way to the Felbound Enforcers and kill them to get the minibosses to spawn. After you've killed the three mini-bosses you can kill the boss. </p>
            <p><i>Note: there are <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Di4QEe4.jpg">class/race/profession specific buffs</a> scattered all over the map at this point. Most notable is Discarded Junk which can be used to instantly kill a boss (or two if you kill a felbound enforcer, immediately use the trap and then kite both bosses over the trap) which can save you a ton of time.</i></p>
            <p>After you've killed the second boss go get your disguise, play Guess Who with a dreadlord, and make your way to the final boss. As the Dreadlord miniboss is dying you can have someone start running toward the final boss door so they can get it unlocked while the RP is going.</p>
            <p><i>Note: DeadlyBossMods automatically calls out the infiltrator's traits in party chat after you've interacted with a Chatty Rumormonger. There are some WeakAuras that do this too if you find yourself running CoS a lot.</i>.</p>
    <h2>Trash tips and warnings</h2>
            <p>Interrupt Guardian Construct's <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=225100/charging-station">Charging Station</a>. This heals ALL nearby enemies for an unruly amount at higher keystone levels (especially when Fortified is active) and also increases enemy damage. Not sure if it can be spellstolen or dispelled. (haven't tried)</p>
            <p>Mana Saber's <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=209516/mana-fang">Mana Fang</a> can be devastating on higher keystones, especially if they get bolstered or have Fortified. These mobs should be killed as soon as possible while interrupting the Guardian Constructs. The debuff can be dispelled.</p>
            <p>Burst down Watchful Inquisitors as <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=212784/eye-storm">eye storm</a> can do unreasonable AoE damage if left unchecked.</p>
            <p>Blazing Imps are the worst and need to be killed as fast as possible. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211401/drifting-embers">Drifting Embers</a> will trash your group if left unchecked. Arcane Torrent, Bursting Shot, Typhoon, any AoE stuns you have should be used on the imps. Try to avoid pulling packs of imps with other mobs so you have less to worry about.</p>
            <p>Felbound Enforcer's <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211464/fel-detonation">Fel Detonation</a> MUST BE line of sighted by anyone that can at higher keystone levels as it is very difficult to keep five people alive if they have the DoT on them. This will wipe your group easily on 9+ difficulties. There are plenty of buildings/pillars/corners in the area you can use to line of sight the cast.</p>
    
        <h2>Boss tips</h2>
            <p> Patrol Captain Gerdo (Bloodlust) - Poison the vial! This is a big time saver and wipe deterrent as it kills him instantly at 25% HP, preventing his enrage. If you don't have a rogue or an alchemist, bummer. Pull the boss back toward the bridge that lead you to the boss arena to avoid accidentally pulling more trash. Jump to dispel <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=207278/arcane-lockdown">Arcane Lockdown</a> as this will kill you very quickly at higher keystone levels. Avoid shiny shit on the ground and ignore adds.</p>
            <p>Fire warlock lady (Talixae Flamewreath) - If you skipped the patrol, pull her back into the pavilion behind her starting position. Stack for <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211457/infernal-eruption">Infernal Eruption</a> to get all the imps to spawn near each other. The tank should move the boss away from the pools and the imps should be killed immediately when they spawn. Kick Withering Soul.</p>
            <p>Advisor Melandrus (Bloodlust) - This fight is a supreme DPS and healing check, especially with Tyrannical. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=209602/blade-surge">Blade Surge</a> targets the furthest player, doing burst damage and applying a DoT that does a shitload of damage. It also leaves a clone of Melandrus there that mirrors Melandrus' other abilities. Avoid the lines on the ground and avoid the clones of Melandrus. If you're a mage/hunter/paladin you can dodge or avoid the Blade Surge by using a personal. That's about all I have to say for this guy as there isn't really anything special you can do with him.</p>
